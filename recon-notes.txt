Base on what were learned thus far, the Information gathering can be achieved as follow:

1.  Starting with nmap scans using flags such as -sS, -sP, -P (for specific port or range), --open (for confirmed open ports).

2.  Also run snmp-check [target] to get enumeration about the target. More particularly of the following interests:
• List of users
• List of software installed
• Domain information
• Processes
• Services

3.  Use other tools such as enum4linux is also helpful, OpenVAS scan (like Qualys), nbstat, etc. to find additional information about the target.

4.  BRUTE FORCE using hydra on available service first with wordlists in /usr/share/seclists/, Passwords directory with 10k wordlist is a good starting point. There are also 10_million as well.

STOP AND EVALUTE, need to enum more??

4a.  Upon learning more about the target, using sites such as exploit-db to start mapping out what exploits can be used.

5.  Start attacking with metasploit by using "use exploit/..."

6.  MSF should reverse shell back during exploitation, however, if not spawn a handler to listen on incoming connection request using "use exploit/multi/handler" then set proper LHOST, LPORT.

7.  Once shell is gained, using commands such as "run post/windows/gather/enum_xxx" for further enumeration about the target.

8.  Using "search -f *.fileextension" via meterpreter is also helpful.

9.  Also look to run concurrent exploits by backgrounding the current session the "use exploit/" again.

10. For post exploitation, most often it is required to have an active exploited session. Use commands such as "sessions -l" to list and to interact use "sessions -i #" where # can be 1,2,3,etc.

11. Continue enumerating until root/Admin is gained.

12. Things to look for withing targets: 
• software, 
• registry (using reg -k HLKM to interact with registry), 
• dump screenshot
• Look at IE version and windows version
• Look at processes running using "ps"
• Using migrate command to investigate migrating into a higher privilege process
• Also using exploits/windows/escalte/run_as can be another good one
• Repeat step 4

13. For hosts with web servers:
   a. run nikto scan: nikto -h <ip>
   b. gobuster -e - u http://10.11.1.x -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

14. Exploit misconfigured NFS shares: https://www.computersecuritystudent.com/SECURITY_TOOLS/METASPLOITABLE/EXPLOIT/lesson4/index.html
