.72 (tough one but learned a lot)
.116 (easy one to get and root because a couple of vulnerable web apps)

.202 (oracle server via msf, will revisit with manual exploit later)
.209 (spinbike, you should take a look at this one. It's right in your powerhouse, should be under 15 minutes to root)
.251 (not on list, but a bridge into 10.1.1.0/24 network. I'm glad I came across this IP. There might be more.)

Other internal network:

10.1.1.246 (which is the same as .251 above but has different routing table to bridge the two segments)
